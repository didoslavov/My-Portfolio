        Hi! I&apos;m Deyan Slavov -{" "}
        <span className="text-wine dark:text-sheen-gold">Dido</span>. At the end
        of 2022, I decided to make a big change and switch my career to
        something I&apos;ve always loved - programming. I&apos;ve always been
        fascinated by technology, but it took me a while to gather the courage
        to try it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my career shift, I have also experienced other positive
        changes in my life. I became a father, which has been one of the most
        fulfilling experiences. This new chapter has inspired me to adopt a
        healthier lifestyle, and I now enjoy long walks by the sea with my
        family, appreciating the simple joys of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding, I dive into the enchanting world of fantasy
        and magic. I&apos;m an avid fan of fantasy books, movies, TV shows,
        games, and everything fantasy-related. I love getting lost in their
        magical worlds and the excitement they bring. Sharing these experiences
        with my loved ones is something I cherish deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I continue to grow as a developer, I&apos;m excited to bring my
        unique perspective, dedication, and enthusiasm to every project I start.
        Resonating with Terry Pratchett&apos;s words from Discworld -{" "}
        <span className="text-wine dark:text-sheen-gold">
          &ldquo;So much universe, and so little time.&rdquo;
        </span>
        - I&apos;m reminded of the boundless opportunities within the JavaScript
        ecosystem.
      </p>

        Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I hope to connect with you
        soon!
